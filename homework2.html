<h1>Crestedgecko</h1>
<p>The crested gecko or eyelash gecko (Correlophus ciliatus) is a species of gecko native to southern New </p>

<p>Caledonia (France). In 1866, the crested gecko was described by French zoologist Alphonse Guichenot.</p>

<p>This species was thought to be extinct until it was rediscovered in 1994 during an expedition led by Robert Seipp.</p>

<p>Along with several other New Caledonian gecko species, it is being considered for protected status by the Convention on </p>

<p>the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna.</p>
